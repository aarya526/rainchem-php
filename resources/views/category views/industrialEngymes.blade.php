                        <p>Enzymes have gained immense importance for their widespread use in industry & medicine owing to
                            their stability,catalytic activity and ease in production.Enzymes are technology boosters that
                            are responsible for catalyzing products into optimum performance.Industrial Enzymes find
                            application in pharmaceuticals, Chemical Production, Bio Fuels,Food & Beverage and even consumer
                            products.Biocatalysis through isolated enzymes is considered more economical than use of whole
                            cells.Enzymes may be used as unit of operation within a process to generate a desired product,
                            or may be the product of interest.Industrial biological catalysis through enzymes has
                            experienced rapid growth in recent years due to their ability to operate at mild conditions, and
                            exceptional chiral and positional specificity, things that hydrolytic and isomerization
                            reactions.
