                        <p>Fabric & textile care has assumed high significance in terms of the cost & emotional value
                            attached with them. For large institutions, it is a symbol of their standard & value. Hence in
                            industrial & consumer laundering, it is important to determine the type of fabric, soil & follow
                            the recommended cleaning code in terms of products & work methodology.
                        </p>
                        <p>Large Institutions require constant flow of clean linen, working clothing / uniform & will often
                            employ the services of industrial laundry or will have one on-premise. Hospitals, prisons,
                            hotels, educational institutions, garment exporters, textile processors will usually have their
                            own laundry departments. The organized collection, laundering & timely delivery of textile
                            service ware is essential to the operation of the institution. Besides the right procedure &
                            practices to be followed, the importance of detergents & chemicals is extremely high.
