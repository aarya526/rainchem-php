                        <p>Pharma Hygiene is of extreme importance as it involves manufacturing of pharmaceutical products
                            that go into human life care and safety.There are various regulatory guidelines for maintenance
                            of high level of hygiene at personal & production levels.Pharmaceutical companies need to
                            guarantee hygienic production environment to ensure safety from contamination of all sorts and
                            at all levels.There are critical control points that need to be identified and monitored closely
                            & such surfaces should be sampled and tested at regular intervals to maintain higher order of
                            check & control.Besides Good Personal Hygiene, Pharma manufacturing companies need to maintain
                            micro-biological hygiene controls in production rooms, storage spaces, manufacturing equipment &
                            other related surfaces.
